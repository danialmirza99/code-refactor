# code-refactor

## Description

This homework assignment is designed to test our ability to understand, read, and write css and html code. The process of the assignment includes reading through the given code and understanding the purpose of each line. Next, we remove code that is not needed. In the given code, there was a lot of code that was not needed or simply repeated. The two biggest examples were end tags for images, written as </img>, and classes in the css file that had the exact same content. To "clean this", I simply removed the end tag and combined the classes in the css page to remove clutter. Finally, I changed some values of the code while keeping the webpage content exactly the same.
